      "During my full-stack web development bootcamp, I learned how to build secure, interactive, and user-friendly web applications from end to end. I gained hands-on experience setting up a complete backend environment from scratch, connecting it to a database, and handling smooth data flow between the server and the user. My final project was a fully functional vacations site. It featured secure authentication using JWT, allowing users to register, log in, and access protected endpoints. Admin users had full control over vacation data, with the ability to create, update, or delete vacations in real time. I learned a variety of programming languages including React, TypeScript, Redux, Docker, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.",
